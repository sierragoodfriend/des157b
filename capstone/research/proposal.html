    <h1>Capstone Project Proposal</h1>
    <h2>AI & the Judicial System</h2>

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>
            For my capstone project, I want to explore what the future would look like if we implemented artificial intelligence in our judicial systems. 
        </p>

        <h3>Audience</h3>
        <p>
            Every US citizen is impacted by judicial systems. We are all assigned jury duty, and we feel the impact of decisions made in our courts. Some citizens are tried in court and can face life altering consequences.  
        </p>
        <p>
            Any biases prevalent in our court systems therefore have the potential to harm individuals. My intention is to assess biases in the judicial system and to explore how AI could potentially eliminate them.
        </p>

        <h3>Focal Points</h3>
        <p>
            In DES 157b, we've done a lot of preparation work for our proposal by looking through various futuritic lenses. I plan on using speculative design in order to demonstrate the current state of our judicial systems, and then to imagine future senarios in which these systems are hopefully benefitted through the implementation of AI.
        </p>
        <p>
            I will also be looking at dystopian and utopian ideas of the future. I hope to create some sort of meaningful interactions with users that addresses dystopian injustices already prevalent in our judicial systems today.
        </p>
        <p>
            Data visualization will be a key component in my project. Having completed my psychology major at UC Davis, I have learned extensively about how humans use stereotypes inherently. I have also learned about various biases that could influence court decisions, and evidence that even judges are not impartial to biases and physiological circumstances (like hunger). The inherent nature of stereotyping and biases makes me question the fairness and equality of our court systems. 
        </p>

        <h3>Features of My Project</h3>
        <p>
            I hope to have interactive features like a poll – asking people if they think courts are biased, if they think they are more biased than others, etc... And then display their results next to averages (and potentially others who have used the website).
        </p>
        <p>
            I believe that a scroll function could be useful in keeping users entertained while they digest information at a rate they are comfortable with.
        </p>
        <p>
            I want my website to be engagin and imaginative. It should involve user input while also educating users about biases in courts and proposing a potential solution through AI.  
        </p>

        <h3>Concerns</h3>
        <p>
            I am not sure whether or not AI will develop in a way that allows it to make life altering decisions in court. However, I believe that we could develop this technology in this direction, and I believe it would eliminate biases. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I also have concerns with people possibly hacking AI interfaces, or the pushback against AI making heavily politicized decisions – on abortion for example.
        </p>
        <p>
            As they stand now, I do believe our judicial systems are biased to a flawed degree, and hope that my proposal can spark interest into addressing these biases and changing this system.
