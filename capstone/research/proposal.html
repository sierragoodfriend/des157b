        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>
            For my capstone project, I want to explore what the future would look like if we implemented rent controlled communal living spaces/complexs rather than having individual housing units. 
        </p>

        <h3>Audience</h3>
        <p>
            My audience is pretty expansive! I want to reach people who cannot afford a house and want alternatives to consider. I also want to reach people who have experieneced the loneliness that can sometimes accompny living in small family units.
        </p>
        <p>
            Housing has become a means of profit rather than a basic need. I want to propose and alternative to the direction we are going in now. 
        </p>

        <h3>Focal Points</h3>
        <p>
            In DES 157b, we've done a lot of preparation work for our proposal by looking through various futuritic lenses. I plan on using speculative design in order to demonstrate the current state of our housing system, and then to show/imagine possible futures with more inclusive & communal housing.
        </p>
        <p>
            I will also be looking at dystopian and utopian ideas of the future – our world without adequate housing for the majority perhaps? Or a world with more communal living, child assistance, social interaction, affordable housing...
        </p>

        <h3>Features of My Project</h3>
        <p>
            I hope to have interactive features like a poll – asking people if they would consider buying a property with a friend for example and having a two family unit. Then asking bigger questions – like would you live in a communal living complex.
        </p>
        <p>
            I believe that a scroll function could be useful in keeping users entertained while they digest information at a rate they are comfortable with.
        </p>

        <h3>Concerns</h3>
        <p>
            I don't think communal living would be implemented smoothly. For example, I feel like if you try to keep a space clean with others, there can be people that fall short and others who have to pick up their slack.
        </p>
        <p>
            I also have concerns with safety issues of living in larger communities – but I believe that more supportive / small scale community environments could potentially help eliminate safety issues over time.
