            This article asserts that judicial systems are in fact overworked and inefficient. However, it also details that AI is probably not going to replace judges. Rather, AI can make the entire system work more cohesively. This has launched me into a subsection of research on data collection – I remember listening to a podcast about a woman who went missing on a college campus. All of the evidence was there, but it wasn't compiled correctly. Perhaps AI can be used in detective work and data collection in judicial systems so that the process of collecting evidence is more thorough.
