            This article follows someone who founded a communal house. It focuses on the positive spin of communal living that I want to zero in on. I've been concerned with the downsides (living with someone unsafe, dirty conditions), but reading this reminded me of my original drive in choosing this topic – communal living is less lonely, more sustainable, and could help resolve the housing crisis.

            This article focuses on communal housing and the housing crisis. It details ways in which society could be bettered with less individual housing. This is so important and central to my findings and overall proposal.
