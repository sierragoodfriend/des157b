        <h3>World Governments Summit</h3>
        <p>
            A great deal of the websites I have been looking at have are from governmental organizations, and are composed of a professional layout, a white background, and chunks of text (See below).
        </p>

            These layouts effectively convey information for this kind of serious topic. While I can draw inspiration from the color choices, layout, and in this case, the content, I'd like to have more interactivity on my website.

        <h3>UNSW Sydney</h3>

        <p>
            One of the more decorated websites I looked at was UNSW Sydney's article on AI replacing judges. I liked the banner image on the article (see below)because it's visually engaging.
        </p>

        <p>
            However, the article takes a simialar route to all the rest with its content (see below). The background is white, simple images are used, and there is no engagement.  
        </p>

        <p>
            I couldn't find any particularly interactive or engaging websites on this topic. I think it's important to have more developed user interfaces on our websites in order to encourage users to engage with the material in a meaningful and memorable way.
        </p>

        <p>
            I'm going to have more user interactivity in my own project, but these websites are a reminder to make the material accessible and easy to read / digest.
