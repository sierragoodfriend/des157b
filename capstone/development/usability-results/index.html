                    First, I noticed that Elizabeth didn't understand what the point of the project was right off the bat. There needs to be more linguistic guidance to help users understand the theme and make the viewing experience more comprehensive.
                </li>
                <li>
                    There's too much text in general. The game took too long to read, the overlay text is too much in the cityscape window...
                </li>
                <li>
                    The game questions could use refining. They didn't seem to be clear to Elizabeth while playing, and after she reported that the game could use more guidance and more relavent questions. 
                </li>
            </ol>
        </ul>

        <p>
            I plan to revise my project by making my writing more consise so that viewers stay engaged. I want to have more clear purpose, perhaps with an overlay title scene at the beginning so that viewers can understand the overall theme better and therefore interact with the project more easily. I think the interactions are easy to navigate once you know what to do on the page, but I need to explicitly guide viewers towards the things I intend for them to do.
